# AI Compliance System - Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This security audit evaluates the AI Compliance System's adherence to industry security standards, focusing on SEBI compliance, DPDP data protection, and AI system security. The system demonstrates strong security foundations with room for enhancement in AI-specific controls.

## Security Architecture Overview

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: All API endpoints protected with JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for compliance operations
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Required for high-risk operations
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Data Classification**: PII, PHI, and financial data properly classified
- **Data Retention**: Automated data lifecycle management

### AI Security Controls
- **Model Validation**: Input validation and sanitization for AI models
- **Adversarial Input Protection**: Guards against prompt injection attacks
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP integration for decision transparency
- **Bias Detection**: Regular audits for algorithmic bias

## Compliance Framework

### SEBI Compliance (Indian Securities Regulation)
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time surveillance of securities transactions
- **Reporting Requirements**: Automated generation of regulatory reports
- **Audit Trails**: Complete transaction and decision traceability
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous risk scoring and alerting

### DPDP Compliance (Data Protection & Privacy)
- **Data Minimization**: Collection limited to necessary compliance data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for stated compliance purposes
- **Consent Management**: User consent tracking for data processing
- **Data Subject Rights**: Implementation of access, rectification, erasure rights

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks Identified

#### 1. AI Model Vulnerabilities
**Risk Level**: High
